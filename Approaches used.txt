Approchaes used for the hack:

1.I have used R 3.4.3 for coding and model building.First,I have verified the data quality with EDA,outlier check,missing value and correlation analysis.

2.For missining values,I have imputated numerical variables with their means.

3.For categorical variables, I have used Label Encoding.Label encoding found to be more useful compared to one hot encoding for this data set.

4.Gained some useful insights for the variables with the help of correlation analysis.

5.Have done some basic feature engineering like rounding off the variable "Loan_Period" which helped to improve the score.

6.For model building,I have used Xgboost algorithm.Here,I have built 2 xgb models.

7.I have tuned the parameters of the xgb models to verify the scores.

8.Finally,I have used weighted-average ensembling method to boost the score.

9.My final submission is based on the weighted-average score of my 2 best xgboost models.

10.Additionally,I have tried Neural networks for model building.But,NN was found to be not much helpful to improve the public lb scores.
Hence,I have excluded the NN implementation part from my codes.
